<h1>Bridge 1 Reflection</h1>
<p>_____________________________________________</p>
<h3> ANALYSIS:</h3>
<p>The first bridges cross members worked well, with only one bar breaking on the top by the crusher. This is because we made the bars thick and the joints there were well glued togther there. Something that didn't work with this bridge was how it had bucked in between the middle of the structure and one of the abutments. This is mainly because of joint failure from the adbutments not properly being glued together. <p>
<h3> IMPROVEMENTS:</h3>
<p>Something that we can do based on what happend with our first bridge is that we can take time and make sure that all the joints are glued well and steady.</p>
<h1>Bridge 2 Reflection</h1>
<P>______________________________________________</P>
<h3>ANALYSIS</h3>
<p>This bridge worked well and didn't break by holding lots of force on the top, as it was thick and well glued together. The problem was the bottom cross beams. They suffered joint failure and one of the cross beam was missing another bar. </p>
<h3>IMPROVEMENTS:</h3>        
<p>Something that we can do to improve this design is to again make sure the joints are glued together well. We can also make sure to spend a little more time on making sure the crossbeams, especially on the bottom.  </p>
